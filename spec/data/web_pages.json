There&#39;s only one criteria for being eligable to win this challenge:</div><div> </div><div><strong>You must not have submitted an entry for any other CloudSpokes challenge prior to registering for this challenge!</strong></div><div> </div><div>For this challenge, we thought we&#39;d make it <a href=\"http://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF12/\" target=\"_blank\">Dreamforce</a> related, since the largest cloud event of the year is happening this month. We&#39;re simply asking that you build a mashup on:</div><br>-- Salesforce (Force.com), and/or <br>-- Heroku <br><br>And using an API from one of these major developer partners. You determine what you want to build. Perhaps something fun (t<a href=\"http://www.kindlegraph.com/\" target=\"_blank\">his guy build Kindlegraph</a> for DocuSign for our hackathon awhile ago) or something actually business related. The sky&#39;s the limit.<br><br>-- Google<br>-- AWS<br>-- Box<br>-- DocuSign<br>-- Twilio<br><br>To be clear - your final app will (1) be hosted on either Force.com or Heroku, and (2) use on a service or API from Google, AWS, Box, DocuSign, or Twilio. So if you&#39;re even remotely interested in participating for this challenge - register now! <br>",
