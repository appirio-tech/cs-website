But this makes it hard to get structured feedback, and creating a survey feels to heavyweight. The instant pulse check app solves all that. It?s great for structured feedback to the quick question and can be used to get quick feedback from a group of people and show the results changing in real time (e.g. polling a room full of people on a presentation).",
