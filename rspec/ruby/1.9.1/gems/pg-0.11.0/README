= ruby-pg: Ruby interface to PostgreSQL RDBMS

This is the extension library to access a PostgreSQL database from Ruby. This
library works with PostgreSQL 7.4 and later.

== Requirements

* Ruby 1.8.7-p174 or later.
* PostgreSQL 7.4 or later installed.

It may work with earlier versions as well, but those are not regularly tested.

== How To Install

Install via RubyGems:

  gem install pg

Or install from source:

  rake install

You may need to specify the path to the 'pg_config' program installed with
Postgres:

  rake -- --with-pg-config=<path to pg_config>

For example, on a Mac with PostgreSQL installed via MacPorts 
(<tt>port install postgresql84</tt>):

  rake install -- --with-pg-config=/opt/local/lib/postgresql84/bin/pg_config

See README.OS_X for more information about installing under MacOS X, and 
README.windows for Windows build/installation instructions.
