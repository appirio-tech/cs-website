=== Configuration

You should have something like this in config/initializers/airbrake.rb.

  Airbrake.configure do |config|
    config.api_key = '1234567890abcdef'
  end

(Please note that this configuration should be in a global configuration, and
is *not* environment-specific. Airbrake is smart enough to know what errors are
caused by what environments, so your staging errors don't get mixed in with
your production errors.)

You can test that Airbrake is working in your production environment by using 
this rake task (from RAILS_ROOT):

  rake airbrake:test

If everything is configured properly, that task will send a notice to Airbrake 
which will be visible immediately.
