= Turn 0.8.0

Version 0.8.0 is a fairly significant release for Turn. This release
adds support for Ruby 1.9's Minitest framework. You can even use
minitest with Ruby 1.8 by supplying the --minitest option on the turn
command line.

In addition, two new reporters have been a added, a new "pretty" reporter
which provides a more a modern "OSX" look (thanks Paydro) and a Cue
reporter which seeks user input with each failure or error (thanks
Shindo).

With this release we are encouraging users to move away from using
autorun modes. Autorunning is when your test script includes code
that "automagically" sets up a test runner, e.g. require 'test/unit'
and MiniTest::Unit.autorun, and by simply running the scripts
through the ruby interpretor the tests get run. There are a number
of problems with this approach. To begin with, running tests this way
limits Turn of a single mode of operation (that's no fun!) More
importantly it prevents interoperability between the old TestUnit
and the new MiniTest systems. By leaving these out and using a 
commandline runner you can use the same tests for each version of
Ruby. This may require some adjutments to build tools, but hell,
why not use Turn there too. The Turn::Controller class makes it
damn easy.

One last note. Turn is no longer compatible with TestUnit 2.0+.
TestUnit and MiniTest are deverging and after some consideration
it was decided that Turn's goal is to support Ruby's native test
framework, whatever it may be.

Enjoy!
