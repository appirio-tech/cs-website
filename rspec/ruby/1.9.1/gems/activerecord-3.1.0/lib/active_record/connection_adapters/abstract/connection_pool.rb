    # Connection pool base class for managing Active Record database
    # connections.
    #
    # == Introduction
    #
    # A connection pool synchronizes thread access to a limited number of
    # database connections. The basic idea is that each thread checks out a
    # database connection from the pool, uses that connection, and checks the
    # connection back in. ConnectionPool is completely thread-safe, and will
    # ensure that a connection cannot be used by two threads at the same time,
    # as long as ConnectionPool's contract is correctly followed. It will also
    # handle cases in which there are more threads than connections: if all
    # connections have been checked out, and a thread tries to checkout a
    # connection anyway, then ConnectionPool will wait until some other thread
    # has checked in a connection.
    #
    # == Obtaining (checking out) a connection
    #
    # Connections can be obtained and used from a connection pool in several
    # ways:
    #
    # 1. Simply use ActiveRecord::Base.connection as with Active Record 2.1 and
    #    earlier (pre-connection-pooling). Eventually, when you're done with
    #    the connection(s) and wish it to be returned to the pool, you call
    #    ActiveRecord::Base.clear_active_connections!. This will be the
    #    default behavior for Active Record when used in conjunction with
    #    Action Pack's request handling cycle.
    # 2. Manually check out a connection from the pool with
    #    ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.checkout. You are responsible for
    #    returning this connection to the pool when finished by calling
    #    ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.checkin(connection).
    # 3. Use ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.with_connection(&block), which
    #    obtains a connection, yields it as the sole argument to the block,
    #    and returns it to the pool after the block completes.
    #
    # Connections in the pool are actually AbstractAdapter objects (or objects
    # compatible with AbstractAdapter's interface).
    #
    # == Options
    #
    # There are two connection-pooling-related options that you can add to
    # your database connection configuration:
    #
    # * +pool+: number indicating size of connection pool (default 5)
    # * +wait_timeout+: number of seconds to block and wait for a connection
    #   before giving up and raising a timeout error (default 5 seconds).

    # ConnectionHandler is a collection of ConnectionPool objects. It is used
    # for keeping separate connection pools for Active Record models that connect
    # to different databases.
    #
    # For example, suppose that you have 5 models, with the following hierarchy:
    #
    #  |
    #  +-- Book
    #  |    |
    #  |    +-- ScaryBook
    #  |    +-- GoodBook
    #  +-- Author
    #  +-- BankAccount

    # the same connection pool. Likewise, Author and BankAccount will use the
    # same connection pool. However, the connection pool used by Author/BankAccount
    # is not the same as the one used by Book/ScaryBook/GoodBook.
