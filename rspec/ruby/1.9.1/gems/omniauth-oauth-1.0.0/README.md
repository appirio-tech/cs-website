# OmniAuth OAuth

**Note:** This gem is designed to work with the in-beta OmniAuth 1.0
library. It will not be officially released on RubyGems.org until
OmniAuth 1.0 is released.

This gem contains a generic OAuth strategy for OmniAuth. It is meant to
serve as a building block strategy for other strategies and not to be
used independently (since it has no inherent way to gather uid and user
info).

## Creating an OAuth Strategy

To create an OmniAuth OAuth strategy using this gem, you can simply
subclass it and add a few extra methods like so:

    require 'omniauth-oauth'

    module OmniAuth
      module Strategies
        class SomeSite < OmniAuth::Strategies::OAuth
          # Give your strategy a name.
          option :name, "some_site"

          # This is where you pass the options you would pass when
          # initializing your consumer from the OAuth gem.
          option :client_options, {:site => "https://api.somesite.com"}

          # These are called after authentication has succeeded. If
          # possible, you should try to set the UID without making
          # additional calls (if the user id is returned with the token
          # or as a URI parameter). This may not be possible with all
          # providers.
          uid{ request.params['user_id'] }

          info do
            {
              :name => raw_info['name'],
              :location => raw_info['city']
            }
          end

          extra do
            {
              'raw_info' => raw_info
            }
          end

          def raw_info
            @raw_info ||= MultiJson.decode(access_token.get('/me.json')).body
          end
        end
      end
    end

That's pretty much it!
