<!-- Example of a WSDL with two <binding> tags.

     This is stripped down from a real example found in the wild, although
     having different operations for the SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2 bindings
     is hypothetical (the real-world example I saw had the same operations
     in each binding section). -->
