CountrySelect
=============

Provides a simple helper to get an HTML select list of countries.  The list of countries comes from the ISO 3166 standard.  While it is a relatively neutral source of country names, it will still offend some users.

Users are strongly advised to evaluate the suitability of this list given their user base.

Example
=======

country_select("user", "country_name")
